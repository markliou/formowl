# Knowledge Graph Research Agent Goal

## Role

Knowledge Graph Research Agent.

Durable role definition: `docs/agent-roles.md`.

## Current Objective

Complete the FormOwl Knowledge Graph method exploration and acceptance work:
fill in external recent literature comparison, ontology integration method,
multi-user KG and KG fusion experiments, multimodal enterprise-data validation,
human operation / annotation / adjudication workflow, production adapter gate,
and a total acceptance suite that clearly marks passed and failed items.

Historical source: Codex session `019eda5f-7dd6-74a2-ac56-4f84e5d58560`.

Status: `active`

## Current Acceptance State

Do not treat the current KG objective as complete.

Two different acceptance layers currently exist:

- Main-repo KG research acceptance slice:
  `scripts/kg_research_acceptance_suite.py` currently reports
  `passed_with_explicit_limits`. This means the method note, deterministic
  fixtures, scoped ontology contracts, candidate-only package boundary, metrics,
  ablations, and explicit limitations are present.
- Broad real-evidence KG acceptance:
  `.formowl/kg-eval/results/kg_total_acceptance_snapshot.json` remains the
  stricter recovery/real-evidence state for the user's full KG objective.
  It currently has `overall_passed=false`, 8 passed gates, and 4 failed gates.

The four failed broad real-evidence gates are:

- `fair_external_baseline_comparison`
- `annotation_adjudication_protocol`
- `multimodal_semantic_validation`
- `production_adapter_paths`

The goal is complete only when the broad real-evidence acceptance state proves
all required gates, the main-repo acceptance suite has no failed or blocked
requirements under strict mode, the work board reflects that state, and the
configured reviewer gate has passed for every newly completed slice.

`passed_with_explicit_limits` is not a completion status for this durable goal.
It is a useful intermediate status that says known limits are explicitly
reported.

## Returned For Rework

2026-06-27 review returned these claims/slices:

- The `Complete KG research acceptance gate` completion claim is rejected for
  the full KG objective. The stricter broad acceptance state is still
  `overall_passed=false` with the four failed real-evidence gates listed above.
- The reviewed canonical graph commit workflow is returned for rework. It must
  demonstrate incremental graph revisions that retain parent revision atoms,
  entities, and relations, and relation commits that can resolve against
  existing canonical endpoints under governance.
- Portability rework started on 2026-06-27: `.gitignore` now allows the
  sanitized `.formowl/kg-eval` harness, restart note, fixtures, templates, work
  orders, work-packet previews, and non-authoritative blocked-state snapshots
  under `snapshots/current_blocked/` to be committed. Generated runtime
  `results/`, long local `HANDOFF.md`, operator real roots under
  `inputs/*_real/`, and canonical real evidence packets remain ignored. This
  fixes the acceptance-authority portability gap; it does not make any broad
  real-evidence gate pass.

## Context Budget Rule

The user requested frequent compaction when executing this goal, even though it
can reduce conversational accuracy, because token budget is the limiting
resource. Treat this goal as compact-friendly work:

- Keep in-chat updates concise and avoid reprinting long artifacts.
- After each meaningful substep, record enough state in durable files to resume
  without relying on chat history.
- Update this goal file or the work-board note after each reviewer attempt,
  blocker, test/verification result, or acceptance-status change.
- Append to `docs/agent-goals/handoff-log.md` when the checkpoint affects a
  future session or another agent.
- Before a planned pause, external approval wait, or likely compaction, write a
  short checkpoint with current status, exact next action, verification state,
  and remaining blocker.

The agent cannot force the external environment to compact on demand, but it
should make every restart cheap and safe by checkpointing more often than usual.

## Abstract

This goal exists because FormOwl's knowledge graph layer must be more than a
method sketch. It must define and test an ontology-grounded, source-preserving,
permission-aware graph fusion workflow for heterogeneous enterprise resources,
including documents, tables, slides, audio/video meetings, images, mail,
project systems, wiki pages, and conversations.

The expected result is not a claim of production readiness by assertion. The
agent must produce reproducible evidence: literature-backed design choices,
baselines, evaluation fixtures, metrics, ablations, error analysis, and clear
limits. Any algorithmic package or LLM may only generate candidates or review
proposals; canonical graph, canonical type, user graph, and wiki state remain
governed outputs.

## Scope

Owned by this agent:

- Candidate graph extraction and preview semantics.
- Ontology/type governance, scoped alignment, and type lifecycle.
- Atom granularity policy, split/merge/coarsening behavior, and lifecycle
  mappings.
- Entity and relation resolution as permission-aware proposal workflows.
- Reviewed canonical graph commit behavior and lineage requirements.
- User graph assembly, effective graph views, graph-derived wiki semantics,
  and projection lineage.
- Evaluation harnesses, datasets, baselines, ablations, reviewer critiques,
  and reproducibility artifacts for KG quality and governance claims.

Not owned by this agent unless explicitly assigned:

- MCP transport implementation.
- Storage backend plumbing.
- Worker execution boundaries.
- Database migrations and production service operations.
- Real OpenProject or wiki backend adapter plumbing.

## Acceptance Criteria

The goal is not complete until current-state evidence proves all of the
following:

- A recent external literature and system comparison that justifies the chosen
  KG fusion, ontology, and evaluation approach, plus a fair external baseline
  protocol that is not self-defined by FormOwl alone.
- Real external baseline execution evidence for the selected baseline systems
  or packages, including locked sources, equalized configs, package/run
  manifests, answer-quality adjudication, graph-quality validation, and
  permission probes.
- A concrete ontology integration method that keeps core supertypes, scoped
  extension types, promoted types, and type alignment candidates separate.
- Experiments for different users, different private scopes, graph overlays,
  revocation, conflict surfacing, and cross-scope fusion without silent access
  grants or canonical merges. Deterministic fixtures are allowed as method
  evidence, but production-quality claims require real or replayable evidence
  packets.
- Multimodal enterprise-resource validation covering at least document/table,
  mail/conversation, project/wiki, and audio/video-style observations or
  fixtures. Claims about real enterprise validation require a validated real
  evidence packet, not only synthetic fixtures.
- Human review, annotation, adjudication, reviewer-disagreement, custody, and
  confusion-matrix evidence where governance claims depend on human judgment.
  Review-queue export alone is not completed human annotation.
- A production adapter gate that clearly separates candidate-only algorithm
  outputs from canonical graph/type mutations and backend service readiness,
  and also proves non-synthetic adapter-path evidence before any production
  readiness claim.
- Metrics for extraction quality, fusion quality, ontology/type alignment,
  provenance completeness, permission safety, latency, and scalability where
  applicable.
- Ablations for ontology guidance, policy gates, candidate review, and
  permission-aware filtering.
- Error analysis and explicit limitations.
- A total acceptance suite or checklist that marks each requirement as passed,
  failed, or blocked with evidence.
- No canonical evidence packet is created from templates, fixtures, sandbox
  paths, stale manifests, symlinks, hardlink aliases, unbound response packets,
  raw/internal paths, raw SQL, object-store/admin endpoints, or worker scratch
  paths.
- The reviewer gate in `docs/agent-goals/reviewer-gate.md` is satisfied for
  each newly completed KG implementation or research slice.

## Required Restart Procedure

At the start of every KG Research Agent session or after compaction, read the
normal repository startup files from `AGENTS.md`, then read:

1. `docs/agent-goals/kg-research-agent.md`
2. `docs/agent-goals/handoff-log.md`
3. `docs/agent-goals/reviewer-gate.md`
4. `.formowl/kg-eval/SESSION_RESTART.md`, if present
5. Tail `.formowl/kg-eval/HANDOFF.md`, if present
6. `.formowl/kg-eval/results/kg_total_acceptance_snapshot.json`, if present
7. `.formowl/kg-eval/results/real_evidence_preflight.json`, if present
8. `.formowl/kg-eval/results/real_evidence_collection_work_orders.json`, if
   present

After reading, derive the active work from current files, not from chat memory.
If the main-repo goal file and `.formowl/kg-eval` disagree, use the stricter
state and update durable docs before claiming progress.

## Execution Rules For Future Sessions

- Work one broad failed gate or one reviewer blocker at a time.
- Do not redefine the objective around the easiest passing subset.
- Do not convert deterministic fixtures into real evidence.
- Do not promote these canonical broad packets unless real evidence exists and
  the corresponding validator accepts it:
  - `inputs/fair_external_baseline_run_packet.json`
  - `inputs/human_annotation_results_v1.json`
  - `inputs/enterprise_multimodal_validation_packet.json`
  - `inputs/production_adapter_evidence_packet.json`
- Candidate-only response intake helpers may write under `inputs/*_real/` only
  for operator-supplied candidate artifacts and must also preserve custody
  hashes. They must not make a broad gate pass by themselves.
- Before pausing, append the exact next action, reviewer state, verification
  state, and remaining failed gates to this file or `handoff-log.md`.

## Verification Baseline

Use the dev container as canonical evidence:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" -w /workspace formowl-dev:local \
  python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Add narrower focused test commands as work lands, but do not report host-only
checks as completion evidence.

For KG research acceptance, also run the strict command when evaluating
completion:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" -w /workspace formowl-dev:local \
  python scripts/kg_research_acceptance_suite.py --strict
```

For broad real-evidence KG acceptance, run the KG-eval acceptance and preflight
commands from `.formowl/kg-eval` in the dev container when those files are
present:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" -w /workspace/.formowl/kg-eval formowl-dev:local \
  python kg_total_acceptance_suite.py
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" -w /workspace/.formowl/kg-eval formowl-dev:local \
  python real_evidence_preflight.py
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" -w /workspace/.formowl/kg-eval formowl-dev:local \
  python -m unittest discover -s . -p 'test_*.py'
```

## Reviewer Gate

Use the default cross-agent reviewer gate from
`docs/agent-goals/reviewer-gate.md`: 6 effective read-only reviewers per newly
completed slice, split as 3 Codex/GPT reviewers and 3 Antigravity Gemini
reviewers through the real local `agy` CLI.

Gemini reviewers must be invoked with Antigravity, for example:

```sh
agy --model "Gemini 3.5 Flash (High)" --print "<review prompt>" --print-timeout 5m
```

This is not Codex `multi_agent_v1`, not a GPT model override, and not an
"agy folder" GPT substitute.

Reviewer cost-control rules:

- Run local focused tests, canonical dev-container tests, and a self-audit
  before asking reviewers.
- Send reviewers a bounded packet for the exact slice, not the whole
  repository history.
- Use Codex/GPT reviewers for local code/test risk and Antigravity Gemini
  reviewers through `agy` for independent method, governance, and adversarial
  critique.
- If a reviewer finds a blocker, fix that blocker and return to the same
  reviewer before expanding to more reviewers.
- Do not count timed-out, errored, vague, no-op, duplicate, or wrong-scope
  reviews.

On any future start or resume of this KG goal, if the remaining work is likely
to need Antigravity Gemini reviewers, ask the user at the beginning for
permission to send a bounded read-only review packet through `agy`. The prompt
must explicitly allow only relevant file paths, design/test summaries,
verification results, claim boundaries, and non-sensitive code or docs
excerpts. It must explicitly exclude secrets, credentials, raw private source
payloads, raw backend paths, NAS or object-store admin endpoints, raw SQL,
worker scratch paths, and unrelated private data. Running `agy` is a separate
sandbox-escalation permission from sending that bounded packet to an external
model.

## Current Handoff Notes

- This file records the durable goal imported from session
  `019eda5f-7dd6-74a2-ac56-4f84e5d58560`.
- On 2026-06-27, the user changed the reviewer gate from 9 effective reviewers
  to 6 effective reviewers: 3 Codex/GPT reviewers and 3 Antigravity Gemini
  reviewers through the local `agy` CLI.
- The current session did not inherit that session-local goal automatically.
  Future sessions should read this file instead of relying on local Codex goal
  state.
- Keep `docs/implementation-task-breakdown.md` as the checkbox work board.
  This file records the objective, acceptance gates, and handoff state.
- 2026-06-27 update: scoped ontology/type governance contracts,
  `formowl_graph.ontology`, KG research acceptance suite,
  `scripts/kg_research_acceptance_suite.py`, and
  `docs/kg-research-method.md` are implemented. Dev-container verification
  passed: changed-file Ruff check and format check, focused ontology contract
  tests (4 OK), focused KG acceptance tests (4 OK), full unittest (246 OK),
  and the default acceptance script. The acceptance suite intentionally reports
  `production_adapter_readiness` as failed and
  `latency_scalability_enterprise_claims` as blocked, with no unexpected
  failed or blocked items. This completed the method/acceptance-harness slice,
  not the full KG objective.
- Reviewer gate status for the KG research acceptance-harness slice is complete at
  6/6. GPT/Codex reviewers `Kuhn`, `Goodall`, and `Pasteur` agreed after
  blocker fixes. Antigravity Gemini reviewers `Ada-Sandbox`,
  `Lamport-Sandbox`, and `Curie-Sandbox` agreed through the real local `agy`
  CLI using sandboxed, closed-book, bounded review packets authorized by the
  user. `Raman` found initial blockers and was replaced for re-review after
  being closed. Initial Antigravity attempts rejected by sandbox policy, the
  `Ada` timeout, and the aborted/timed-out `Ada-Retry` run do not count.
- 2026-06-27 update: the user requested that future resumes of this goal ask
  for Antigravity Gemini bounded-review authorization at the start of the run,
  not after local work is complete. Treat this as the first action before
  substantial work whenever the reviewer gate is expected to need `agy`.
- 2026-06-27 update: the user requested frequent compaction for this goal to
  conserve token budget. Use short, durable checkpoints in this file, the work
  board, and the handoff log so future compact/resume cycles recover state
  without large chat history.
- 2026-06-27 method-slice checkpoint: current-state verification passed in the
  dev container: default KG research acceptance suite returned
  `passed_with_explicit_limits` with only expected
  `production_adapter_readiness` failed and
  `latency_scalability_enterprise_claims` blocked; focused KG acceptance tests
  ran 4 OK; focused ontology tests ran 4 OK; full
  `python -m unittest discover -s tests` ran 246 tests OK. The work-board KG
  Research Evaluation and Acceptance method-slice item is checked complete.
- 2026-06-27 correction checkpoint: this durable goal was previously marked
  `complete`, but current stricter evidence contradicts that. The broad
  `.formowl/kg-eval` acceptance snapshot still has `overall_passed=false` with
  failed gates for fair external baseline comparison, real human annotation,
  real enterprise multimodal validation, and production adapter paths. Treat
  the durable KG objective as `active` until those gates pass with real
  evidence and strict main-repo KG research acceptance has no failed or blocked
  requirements.
- 2026-06-27 portability checkpoint: the strict broad KG-eval harness is now
  intended to be tracked as non-sensitive acceptance authority. Runtime
  `results/` remain local ignored outputs; `snapshots/current_blocked/` carries
  non-authoritative blocked-state references that must not be treated as
  completion evidence without rerunning the dev-container commands. The commit
  must still exclude local long-form handoff history, operator real artifact
  roots, and canonical real evidence packets. Current state remains
  `overall_passed=false` with the same four failed gates.
- 2026-06-27 portability verification: canonical dev-container KG-eval
  unittest ran 360 tests OK; main repo unittest ran 246 tests OK; broad
  `kg_total_acceptance_suite.py`, `kg_objective_completion_audit.py`,
  `real_evidence_preflight.py`, and `real_evidence_collection_work_orders.py`
  all ran. Broad KG-eval remains `overall_passed=false` with 8 passed gates and
  4 failed gates. Main-repo KG acceptance default remains
  `passed_with_explicit_limits`; strict mode still fails as expected while
  `production_adapter_readiness` is failed and
  `latency_scalability_enterprise_claims` is blocked.
- 2026-06-27 portability reviewer checkpoint: Antigravity Gemini final-version
  reviews reached 3/3 AGREE after one useful blocker. The blocker was that
  tracking all `inputs/` and runtime `results/` could accidentally commit
  operator artifacts or stale passing result files. The final patch ignores
  arbitrary `inputs/`, runtime `results/`, real roots, canonical evidence
  packets, and long local handoff history, and tracks only fixtures plus
  non-authoritative blocked snapshots. No reviewer approval changes the broad
  KG completion state.
